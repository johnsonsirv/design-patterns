## Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals, merge the overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all intervals in the input.

This problem is concerned with merging overlapping intervals in an array. An interval is defined by two numbers, a start time and an end time, where the start time is less than or equal to the end time. The input to the problem is an array of intervals, and the goal is to merge any intervals that overlap and return an array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

For example, consider the input array of intervals 
```
[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]. 
```

The intervals `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` overlap, so they can be merged into a single interval [1, 6]. 

The resulting array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input would be 

```
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]].
```

The solution to this problem typically involves sorting the array of intervals by their start times, so that overlapping intervals are adjacent to each other in the sorted array. Then, a single pass through the sorted array can be used to merge any overlapping intervals and add the non-overlapping intervals to the result array.

## Runtime Analysis
The time complexity of the solution is O(n log n), due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals in the input array. The space complexity is also O(n), because the merged intervals can take up as much space as the input intervals.

### Edge Cases
The implementation provided covers basic edge cases, but there are some edge cases that it does not cover. For example, if the input array has intervals that are completely nested within other intervals, the current implementation would not handle them correctly.

Also, the implementation assumes that the input intervals are sorted by their start times. If the intervals are not sorted, the function would not produce the correct output.

Additionally, the implementation assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., it does not contain any invalid or malformed intervals. If the input contains such intervals, the function may produce unexpected results.

Therefore, it is important to handle all these edge cases to make the implementation more robust and accurate.

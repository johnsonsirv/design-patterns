## Target sum

Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target sum and return their indices. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution. Return -1 when no index is found.

For example
```
input: [2, 7, 11, 15];
target: 9;

output: [0,1]
```
```
input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
targe: 7

output: [0, 5]
```

```
input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
targe: 16

output: -1
```


```
Hint 1
Start with a hashmap solution and optimize from there.

## Exploring Design Patterns

Using real-world examples to explore and explain design patterns, that is the aim of this project.

Educational purposes only.

`Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.`
